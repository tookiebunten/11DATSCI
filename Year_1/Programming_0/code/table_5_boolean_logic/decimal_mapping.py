"""The numeric values on a Mac keyboard look like this: 
 
If the user holds the shift key while pressing key ‘6’ the symbol ‘^’ is produced. 
Assuming that the user either holds the shift key or doesn’t, while pressing an 
arbitrary number of keys, create a function that receives the resulting list of key 
presses, as numeric values, and the boolean state of the shift key (is_pressed), 
then returns from the function the appropriate mapping from the list of numbers. """
