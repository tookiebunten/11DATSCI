"""This function receives three arguments p1, p2 and r. Assuming that p1 is the 
center of a circle with radius r, then: 
 
if p2 is inside the circle, then return the string:  
“Beyond the event horizon!” 
if p2 is outside the circle, then return the string: 
“So far so good” 
If p2 is equal to the radius, then return the string:  
“Event horizon!” 
In this function you should assume that distance is measured as the Euclidean 
distance. """
