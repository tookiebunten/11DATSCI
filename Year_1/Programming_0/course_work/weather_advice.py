    It returns a list of advice strings based on these inputs using predefined advice strings provided in the script.

    If it is sunny, the function adds "Wear sun cream."
    If it is sunny and hot (temperature greater than 25Â°C), it also adds "It's hot and sunny! Eat some ice cream."
    If it is rainy, the function adds "Carry an umbrella." to the advice.
    If it is both rainy and windy, it adds "It's windy! Hold onto your umbrella tightly."
    Lastly, if it's windy (regardless of rain or sun), the function adds "Hold on to your hat."

    The advice is built dynamically based on the input conditions, and no changes are made to the predefined,
    provided advice strings (these will be used in tests and you will lose marks if you change them)."""
